## The Ettin Adventure Game

This is a fantasy role-playing game for quick, chaotic adventures with friends. Everyone can be protagonists if you agree to share the burden of inventing the world around you during play. Dream up dangers to surprise each other, working together to evade, escape, endure, or eliminate them!

*When you **create random characters** together*, roll three six-sided dice and write the total against the first attribute of the first player's sheet, the second on the second sheet, and so on. Reroll if that number has already been written and you will create  a set of unique sheets. The player with the highest of each attribute names their protagonist character after choosing a role from this table. Your character's role informs which risk-facing abilities they could test using their attributes. Every six points in an attribute gives them an extra point in a related resource (resources start at one).

|   Role Choices   |   Attribute   |   Resource   |   Resource Usage   |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|   Warrior or Monk   |   *Strength*   |   Burden   |   Each point is a *weight you can carry*   |
|   Rogue or Ranger   |   *Dexterity*   |   Luck   |   Spend points to *reroll anyone's die*   |
|   Dwarf or Giant   |   *Constitution*   |   Health   |   Spend points per degree of *harm suffered*   |
|   Mage or Inventor   |   *Intelligence*   |   Lore   |   Spend points to *recall knowledge*, by degrees   |
|   Elf or Druid   |   *Wisdom*   |   Wits   |   Spend points to *notice clues*, by degrees   |
|   Cleric or Bard   |   *Charisma*   |   Contacts   |   Spend points to *introduce people*, by degrees   |

*When you **test an attribute** to face a risk*, try to roll two twenty-sided dice under it. 

* If both roll below, you succeed! 
* If one rolls your attribute or above, success is complicated or costly. 
* If both roll your attribute or above, you fail but also gain a story! 

*When you **evaluate something** of influence*, measure it by three degrees, always balancing risks against rewards (and vice-versa - treasure attracts thieves, spells invite calamities): 

|    Degree    |    Foe    |  Harm   | Treasure  |  Gear   | Contacts |  Magic   |
| :----------: | :-------: | :-----: | :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :------: |
|  *Trivial*   |  Bandits  | Bruises |   Coins   | Mundane |  Local   |  Tricks  |
|  *Notable*   | Soldiers  | Slashes |   Gems    | Scarce  |  Friend  | Wonders  |
| *Remarkable* | Arcanists | Agonies | Artefacts | Unique  | Hireling | Miracles |

*When you **inflict or suffer** harm*, you may render armour useless instead of losing health. A protagonist character (PC) on zero health is unconscious (but not dead until harmed further). A non-protagonist character (NPC) is dead as soon as they reach zero health.

*When you **acquire items** along the way*, their usefulness should be proportionate to what you paid (or overcame) to claim them.

*When you **rest, replenish & repair** overnight*, you regain any spent points. You may also restore any shields/armour if you have access to materials/tools or crafters & their fees.

*When you **have a handful of stories***, at least one of them is worth telling at the tavern, and four worth drinking away. When your stories are told, increase an attribute by one (none higher than 18).

*When you **walk away** from this world*, I hope you have created notes and maps and jokes and ideas to share with players old and new. I hope that your fantasy world becomes one worth returning to.
