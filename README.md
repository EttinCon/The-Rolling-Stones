# The Rolling Stones

This is a fantasy role-playing game for quick, chaotic adventures with friends. Everyone can play a protagonist if you agree to share the burden of inventing the world around you during play. Dream up dangers & treasures to surprise each other, working together to complete the kinds of quests you're all interested in.

*When you **create protagonists** together*, roll three six-sided dice & write the total against an attribute. After doing this six times, name them & devise a unique role within your adventuring party. Every six points in an attribute increases a related resource (resources start at one): Burden is the weight you can carry, Luck is spent to reroll a die, Health when harmed, Lore to recall knowledge, Wits to notice clues, & Contacts to introduce people, all by degrees of usefulness or severity.

*When you **risk consequences** to achieve success*, roll two twenty-sided dice against the most appropriate attribute. Each die rolling below your attribute is some success, each roll equal or above is a consequence.

- If both roll below, you succeed without consequence! 
- If one rolls your attribute or above, you succeed with a lesser consequence. 
- If both roll your attribute or above, you gain a story about failing to avoid all consequences! 

*When you **evaluate** the quality of anything* (magic, monsters, money, or mishaps) measure & group it by three degrees: Trivial, Notable, or Remarkable. Trivial foes have trivial armour & gear. Notable treasure attracts notable thieves who endure (& inflict) notable harm. Remarkable contacts provide remarkable magic for remarkable fees & remarkable risk. Describe these things as impressively as you imagine them to be.

*When you **trade blows** in combat*, harm is inflicted one degree per success, & suffered one degree per consequence. Armour can absorb damage by having its quality reduced by these same degrees. A protagonist character (PC) on zero health is unconscious (but not dead until harmed further). A non-protagonist character (NPC) is dead as soon as they have taken their degree of harm.

*When you want to **specify** how fine or durable an item is*, roll one six sided die per degree & record the total. If you roll a consequence above that item's quality whilst using it, then reduce its quality by one degree, rerolling for the new value. Any item reduced below trivial is irrevocably broken.

*When you **rest, replenish & repair** overnight*, regain any spent resources. You may also restore or improve  shields & armour if you have access to sufficient material, tools, or crafters & their fees for the difference in quality. Advance one worldly threat in your absence, then set out to overcome it.

*When you **have a handful of stories***, at least one of them is worth telling at the tavern, & four worth drinking away. After telling your best story, increase an attribute by one (none higher than 18) & erase your other stories.

*When you **walk away** from this world*, I hope you have created notes & maps & jokes & ideas to share with players old & new. I hope that your fantasy world becomes one worth returning to.
